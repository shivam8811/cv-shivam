# Project Rules

This project's coding conventions are maintained in `.cursor/rules/`. Read and follow all `.mdc` files in that directory — they are the authoritative source for project guidelines.

## Rule Files

- `project-overview.mdc` — tech stack, project structure, code quality principles, communication guidelines
- `styling.mdc` — scoped styles, design tokens, theme, Tailwind + CSS conventions
- `typescript-conventions.mdc` — types, CV data patterns, utils, path aliases
- `vue-components.mdc` — script setup, component organization, auto-imports, icons

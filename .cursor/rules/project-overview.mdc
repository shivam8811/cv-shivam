# Project Overview

Personal CV / portfolio single-page application for Shivam Chaudhary.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Nuxt 4 (Vue 3 Composition API)
- **UI Library**: Nuxt UI 4 (`@nuxt/ui`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, scoped CSS
- **Icons**: Nuxt Icon (`@nuxt/icon`) — Heroicons and Simple Icons
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict)
- **Linting / Formatting**: Biome (tabs, double quotes, recommended rules)
- **Package Manager**: Bun (always use `bun` instead of npm/yarn/pnpm)
- **Git Hooks**: Husky + lint-staged (biome check + nuxi typecheck)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Caddy, deployed via GitHub Actions

## Project Structure

- `app/components/base/` — reusable UI primitives wrapping Nuxt UI
- `app/components/cv/` — CV-specific section components
- `app/data/cv.ts` — static typed CV data
- `app/types/cv.ts` — TypeScript interfaces for CV data
- `app/utils/` — utility functions (auto-imported by Nuxt)
- `app/layouts/` — page layouts
- `app/pages/` — file-based routing (single index page with hash-based tabs)

## Code Quality

- **No comments in code** — write self-documenting code with clear naming instead of comments. If code needs a comment to be understood, refactor it.
- **SOLID** — single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **DRY** — don't repeat yourself; extract shared logic into composables or utils
- **KISS** — keep it simple; prefer straightforward solutions over clever ones
- **YAGNI** — don't build features or abstractions until they are actually needed

## Communication

- **Challenge decisions** — do not hesitate to contradict or push back on decisions if there is a better approach. Explain why and suggest alternatives.
- **Ask when in doubt** — always ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions. Getting it right matters more than getting it fast.
